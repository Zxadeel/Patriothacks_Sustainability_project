# Patriothacks_Sustainability_project

This was a project conceptualized and created during the 2022 PatriotHacks hackathon at George Mason University. I worked in a group of three other students. This was all of our's first hackathon.

We were tasked to create software that would help students place waste items in the correct wastebins. We did this by creating an Android app using Android Studio and Java.
